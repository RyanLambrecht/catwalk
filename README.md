Satisfactory companion tool

> ⚠️ **Not even close to being usable yet**  
> This project is in its very early stages. Right now, it probably has little to no functionality—I’m currently focused on building a custom JSON parser and a CLI version of this before adding a GUI.

## Overview

This is a tool for *Satisfactory* designed to replace the need for spreadsheets when managing your factories. Once complete, it will help you plan, track, and optimize your factory setups more efficiently.

## Planned Features

1. **Homebrew Factory Calculator**
   - Automatically updates in-game recipes using the local `Docs.json`
   - Designed to be future-proof as the game evolves

2. **Factory Manager**
   - Import your current factory layouts based on their input and output
   - Add factories generated by the calculator
   - Suggest when to split a factory into sub-factories based on *volume*, not performance

3. **And probably more** as the project progresses

## Possible Future Features

- Integration for train throughput, especially as rail networks expand
- More features will likely emerge as development continues
